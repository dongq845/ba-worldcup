              My Goal & Inspiration
            </h2>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              As a fan of Blue Archive, I was inspired by large-scale tournament
              platforms like the Korean site{" "}
              <a
                href="https://piku.co.kr"
                target="_blank"
                rel="noopener noreferrer"

                piku.co.kr
              </a>
              . I enjoyed seeing communities vote for their favorites, but I
              noticed there wasn't a global version available for Blue Archive
              fans to share in the fun.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
              That's what motivated me to build this project. My goal was to
              create more than just a simple poll â€” I wanted to design a fun,
              engaging, and fair platform where the global community could see
              rankings play out in a dynamic, tournament-style format, making
              every single choice matter.

                  When you press "Start!", the system generates a unique,
                  single-elimination tournament bracket for you from the full
                  roster of playable students. You vote in each head-to-head
                  matchup by clicking on your choice. The selected student will
                  be highlighted with a green outline before advancing to the
                  next round, continuing until only one winner remains.
